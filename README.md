## This project is the final project I developed for the WebCrafter-Full Stack Bootcamp organized by techcareer.net.
## In this project, I created a book blog site. I implemented user registration and login functionalities and set up authorization with roles. When you first enter the site, posts are displayed in a list format. Logged-in users can create new posts or edit and delete existing ones. I also provided the option to leave comments on posts. By clicking on a post, you can navigate to a page with detailed information about that post, where users can also write their comments. The features I offer in this project enable users to interact extensively with the blog site and manage the content.
